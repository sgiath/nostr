# NIP-42 Authentication
# The relay always sends an AUTH challenge on every new connection so clients
# can optionally authenticate. When required = true, clients MUST respond with
# a signed kind-22242 event before any EVENT/REQ/COUNT is accepted.
# Unauthenticated connections are closed after timeout_seconds.
#
# mode controls access-list behaviour:
#   "none"      — any authenticated pubkey is accepted (default)
#   "whitelist" — only pubkeys in the whitelist are accepted
#   "denylist"  — all pubkeys except those in the denylist are accepted
